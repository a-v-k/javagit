Java client for GIT (http://sim51.github.com/javagit)

This project is a fork of JavaGit (http://javagit.sourceforge.net/).

* Why a fork ?
Because the project is dead (no commit since 2008 ...), and the original project doesn't respond to my criteria of quality. 
However, I need some features that original project doesn't have.
